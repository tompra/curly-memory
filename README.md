# Pok√©dex

## Project description

To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap library that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
User should be able to view a list of pokemons and see more details when clicking on a pokemon. 

### What was your role for this project and what tasks did you face?
In this project I learned the understanding of how to work with JS Promises. This allowed me to handle asyncronous operations such as fetching data from an external API.
I grasped the concept IIFE and its practical application. I realized that IIFE is an effective way to encapsulate code within a function and create a private scope. Helping to maintain and prevent conflict and enhacing the code quality.
Lastly I recognized the importance of reading and understanding of documentation thoroughly. In this case, was the Bootstrap's documentation. 

### What would I improve in the project?
I would try to add pagination to the main page and give more animation to the modal with the extra details of the pokemons.
